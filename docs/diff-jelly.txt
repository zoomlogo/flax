Differences from Jelly¹:
- Evaluation is right to left like APL/BQN/J/K.
- Index origin is 0.
- Different codepage.
- flax has comments unlike Jelly (very important :P).

Similarities with Jelly¹:
- Many builtins are same.
- Chaining rules are the same (except reversed to account for RTL evaluation).
